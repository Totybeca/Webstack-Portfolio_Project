Welcome to the Electronic Store Application project. I'm Ikechukwu Nwamah and i'm a python software engineer. This project like every other web application consist of both the frontend and backend. Emerald Fashemore, Light Eyinnah and Bode Olayeye handled the frontend with Emerald Fashemore as the frontend team leader while I handled the backend because django is a roburst framework and it needs hands on experience before it's features can be greatly integrated. The project is a pre-requisites of the Alx training before we can be fully graduated from the training program. We hope you enjoy the functionalities and features our app tends to offer
